# Stopwatch App

A stopwatch is a device that measures time. It is often used in sports to record the time of athletes during a race, swim, etc. Some smartphones have a feature called “Multi-timers” that lets users set multiple timers for different tasks at the same time, such as cooking.

But what if you want to have multiple stopwatches instead? For example, in a group presentation, you might want to track how long each presenter speaks. A regular stopwatch only has laps, but not multiple stopwatches.

If this sounds useful to you, you will enjoy this quest. You will learn how to build an accurate stopwatch app that allows users to create as many stopwatches as they want. You might remember creating a multiple timer app in a JavaScript quest. We will use similar logic to build this multiple stopwatch app

## This app allows users to do basic calculations

## Tools

### REACT

Use the UseEffect to repeatedly run a function to update the stopwatch state autonomously
Perform object manipulation while updating the stopwatch state
Perform Start, Stop, Lap and Pause operations on the stopwatch
